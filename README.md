# snapshotJoiner
Self contained program written in python 3 that can join snapshots using Gadget2 binary format.

Based in the module "snapwrite" contained in [Rafael Ruggiero](https://github.com/ruggiero)'s IC generation programs, but modified to work in python 3.

Made possible with advice and contributions from [Prof. Dr. Rubens Machado](https://sites.google.com/professores.utfpr.edu.br/rubensmachado/home).
